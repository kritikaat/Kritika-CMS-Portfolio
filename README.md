# 📝 Kritika-CMS-Portfolio

This repository represents my **first self-driven attempt** at integrating **Notion as a CMS** with a **Next.js frontend**, without using any starter templates or cloned repositories.

Instead of relying on pre-built kits, I followed the official Notion API documentation and set up the connection from scratch — including API integration and rendering Notion content on a Next.js-based frontend.

## 🚀 Next Steps

If you're looking to build your own portfolio with this stack, I suggest:

1. Duplicating the Notion template:

2. Configuring `site.config.ts` in your cloned repository
